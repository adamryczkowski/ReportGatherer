Description: The package allow building a report that is implemented as a acyclic tree structure, with
    nodes that represent various report elements. Each node belongs to the class hierarchy using object inheritance.
    For better performance each node can implement a pre-render stage, that can be trivially parallelized.
    Supports the following objects: paragraph_text, section, table, ggchar, generic_chart among others.
